About this project: Create a basic website with flask that allows you to add to a databse and print the database

Assumptions:There is an issue with the print list users using links in linprog where the list users will not update when adding new users
            The issue only shows up on links. The print list users will update if you quit and restart links. 
            It works properly on lynx and on webrowser like google chrome

All work below was performed solely by Shashank Dontireddy

I used the Sample Flask Website example provided in the course website as a template for my project.
